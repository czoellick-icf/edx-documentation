This release adds support for an OpenStack Swift Object Store for user-
uploaded content. Instead of specifically referencing the Amazon S3 service,
the Open edX platform now uses the Django file storage API to define the
cloud storage provider.

Complete documentation is not yet available for this change. For more
information, see the `Add OpenStack Swift Support` PR in GitHub.
